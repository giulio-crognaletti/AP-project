# AP-project
Final project - Advanced Programming - Giulio Crognaletti and Giulia Marchiori Pietrosanti

The folder ```/bst``` contains the source code of the C++ project, in particulare there are the following files:

* ```bst.hpp``` contains the declaration of the class bst and the implementation of inlined functions
* ```bst.cpp``` contains the implementations of more complex functions of ```bst.hpp```
* ```iterator.hpp```contains the declaration of the class ```iterator_class``` and the implementation of inlined functions
* ```iterator.cpp``` contains the implementations of more complex functions of ```iterator.hpp```
* ```test.cpp``` contains the main used to test all the functions

The C++ project is compiled using the make command inside the folder```/bst```.

The file ```python_exam.ipynb``` contains the (two) solutions of the dictionary reversal problem in Python using two different techiniques.
Finally ```Report.md``` contains a breif report on the assignment.
